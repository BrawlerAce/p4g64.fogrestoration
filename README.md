# P4 Fog Restoration
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BrawlerAce/p4g64.fogrestoration/master/assets/description/thumbnail_v2.png)
A visual overhaul mod that restores the Persona 4 visuals to Persona 4 Golden. Check the [wiki](https://github.com/BrawlerAce/p4g64.fogrestoration/wiki) for more detailed information. This mod is also on [GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/wips/86080)!

If you want to see and compare the changes, visit [this website!](https://p4fogmod.maxineis.gay/) *Disclaimer: You can view this on mobile, just expect the site to be weird when you zoom out too far.*

**For the best experience, I recommend setting your in-game contrast setting to 2!**
